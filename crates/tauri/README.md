# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: lighty-tauri

**This crate has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**

## Migration Notice

The Tauri integration for LightyLauncher has been moved to a **standalone repository** to maintain better separation of concerns and allow independent versioning.

### Why is this deprecated?

1. **Better Separation**: Tauri-specific code should live in its own repository
2. **Independent Versioning**: The Tauri plugin can evolve independently from the core library
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: The main library no longer requires Tauri dependencies
4. **Focused Development**: Each repository can focus on its specific purpose

### Where to migrate?

Please use the new standalone Tauri plugin repository:

**🔗 [LightyLauncher Tauri Plugin](https://github.com/Lighty-Launcher/lighty-tauri-plugin)** _(Coming Soon)_

## Timeline

- **v0.9.0**: This crate is marked as deprecated
- **v1.0.0**: This crate will be removed entirely
